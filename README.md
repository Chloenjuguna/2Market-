# 2Market - Exploratory analysis 

## Project Overview
2Market is a global supermarket which sells products online and in-stores. 2Market needs to understand their customer purchase behaviour and effective advertising methods. Therefore, the problem statement is as follows: 2Market has insufficient insight on customer purchasing behaviour and optimal advertising methods. It is probable that the root cause of this problem is organisational in nature, as no previous attempts at analysis
have been made even though the primary data exists. Notably, an issue with using the problem-solving framework arises when the root cause is complex and may be impacted by interlinked factors, making the problem hard to pinpoint. With this in mind, I would like to pose the following questions to the 2Market team: Are all the products available online also available in store for purchase? And are all products available for purchase in all countries?
